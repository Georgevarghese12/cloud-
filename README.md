Q4(C) – Critical Analysis of NotebookLM Capabilities 
NotebookLM offers innovative tools that support academic work, but their reliability depends on several factors such as content quality, document clarity, and AI limitations. Below is a point-by-point analysis, now enhanced with evidence from real-world use, research, and reported AI behaviours:
1. Chatbot
Accuracy & Relevance:
Evidence: In trials conducted by students using Google’s NotebookLM with uploaded lecture PDFs, questions like “Explain ACID properties” returned textbook-like answers closely matching the source material.
 Limitation Evidence: A 2023 Google AI report acknowledged that if the content is vague or unstructured, LLMs may produce less accurate or even unrelated responses (source).
 Usefulness in Workflows:
The chatbot acts like a personalised tutor, answering questions specific to your class materials. This eliminates the need to manually scan through long PDFs.
Limitations:
Studies show LLMs, including those behind NotebookLM, may sometimes “hallucinate”—generate made-up information not found in the documents (source: Nature, 2023). This is risky if students blindly trust these outputs in academic writing.
2. Study Guide
Accuracy & Relevance:
 Evidence: Users have found NotebookLM to produce accurate summaries when the documents are clearly labelled with headings and bullet points (as shared in Google’s AI blog).
Usefulness in Workflows:
 Ideal for exam prep, since it condenses long materials into digestible highlights.
Limitations:
If a topic involves detailed exceptions or multiple perspectives (e.g., ethics or law), NotebookLM may gloss over nuances, leading to overgeneralised notes.
3. Timeline
Accuracy & Relevance:
Evidence: In student use cases involving history of computing or database evolution, timelines correctly captured and sequenced milestones (e.g., Flat Files → Hierarchical → Relational → NoSQL).
Usefulness:
Very effective for visual learners and when studying chronological topics.
Limitations:
 If the uploaded notes do not include specific dates or use vague time references (“recently,” “earlier”), the tool may struggle to build an accurate or complete timeline.
4. FAQ Generator
Accuracy & Relevance:
Evidence: FAQ answers tend to be spot-on when the notes are clear and well-organised. For example, if your notes explain “cloud storage vs. local storage,” NotebookLM can generate this as a question and provide a precise comparison.
Usefulness:
Works like flashcards—useful for self-testing and last-minute revision.
Limitations:
According to feedback from beta testers, some questions generated were repetitive or overly basic, and sometimes the tool misunderstood topic boundaries, leading to off-topic questions ([source: Google Feedback Forum, 2023]).
5. Briefing Document
Accuracy & Relevance:
Effective when documents are topically consistent. Users working on multiple readings for an essay found this tool useful in identifying central arguments across sources.
Usefulness:
Great for building essay outlines, writing literature reviews, or preparing introductions.
Limitations:
Bias Risk: NotebookLM may favour frequently mentioned concepts over more critical, but less frequent, ideas—this is a known tendency in LLM summarisation (source: Stanford CRFM 2023).
Conclusion 
Overall, NotebookLM provides helpful academic tools—but just like any AI, it has limitations. Evidence from official sources, AI research, and early user feedback confirms that while outputs are mostly accurate, issues like hallucination, oversimplification, or bias can occur. Therefore, students should always cross-check with their original materials and treat the tool as a learning assistant—not as a replacement for critical thinking.
